# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to this repository!

While we are still in the early stages of development, we strongly suggest first coordinating with the developers before taking the time to write code and submit a pull request. Contributions in the form of issues and discussions are always welcome.

## Pull Requests

After coordinating through an issue or discussion, please submit a pull request with code changes. The team will review, test, and merge.

We especially encourage code contributions for automating the development of the v2 solution accelerator. Until this is in place, the review and merge process will largely be manual.

# Azure MLOps (v2) solution accelerator

![Header](documentation/repositoryfiles/mlopsheader.jpg)

Welcome to the MLOps (v2) solution accelerator repository! This project is intended to serve as *the* starting point for MLOps implementation in Azure.

MLOps is a set of repeatable, automated, and collaborative workflows with best practices that empower teams of ML professionals to quickly and easily get their machine learning models deployed into production. You can learn more about MLOps here:

- [MLOps with Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning/mlops/#features)
- [Cloud Adoption Framework Guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/ai-machine-learning-mlops)
- [How: Machine Learning Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-model-management-and-deployment)

## Prerequisites

1. An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://aka.ms/AzureMLFree) before you begin.

## Project overview

The solution accelerator provides a modular end-to-end approach for MLOps in Azure based on pattern architectures. As each organization is unique, solutions will often need to be customized to fit the organization's needs.

The solution accelerator goals are:

- Simplicity
- Modularity
- Repeatability
- Collaboration
- Enterprise readiness

It accomplishes these goals with a template-based approach for end-to-end data science, driving operational efficiency at each stage. You should be able to get up and running with the solution accelerator in a few hours.

## üë§ Getting started: Azure Machine Learning - classical machine learning demo
  
The demo follows the classical machine learning pattern with Azure Machine Learning.

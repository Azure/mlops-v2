# Azure MLOps (v2) solution accelerators

_Work in progress_

This repository hosts the MLOps (v2) solution accelerators. It uses [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to generate files and folders based on user selections.

## Getting started

To generate the template files on your local machine, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter gh:Azure/mlops-v2
```

Then follow the prompts cookiecutter surfaces to generate files ready for your project.

<!-- TODO: Update documentation further -->

You can also use the Azure Portal with the buttons in the list below.

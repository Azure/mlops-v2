# Azure MLOps (v2) solution accelerator

_Work in progress_

### Microsoft's State of MLOps 

MLOps or Machine Learning Ops is a set of practices that aims to automate and operationalise the deployment and maintenance of machine learning models across various stages of the lifecycle of a Data Science process. The purpose of an MLOps process is to drive efficiency, increase repeatability and predictability, enable reuse of code and drive consistency across projects. This enables Data Science teams to deploy Machine Learning models to production reliably and efficiently.  

While MLOps has many overlapping concepts with DevOps and can be seen as a derivation of DevOps, it varies significantly from DevOps due to the nature of Data Science projects. The following Microsoft articles provide a perspective on MLOps from various viewpoints:

## Overview of the MLOps Solution Accelerator 

The accelerator provides a modular end-to-end approach for MLOps in Azure based on pattern architectures. As each organization is unique, we do not expect that each pattern architecture will suit all organizations, however, Digital Natives or enterprises will be able to deploy an MLOps ecosystem fast, simple, reliable, modular, and secure. The time to product is measurable shorter under incerased scalability.

Following are the key principles that have been applied while building the accelerator: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simplicity 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Segregation of duties 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reusability 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modularity
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enterprise readiness 


## Repository 

This repo provides a templatised approach for the end-to-end Data Science process and focuses on driving efficiency at each stage. For example, it can take a significant amount of time to bootstrap a new Data Science project, hence the repo provides templates that can be reused to establish a cookie cutter approach for the bootstrapping process to shorten the process from days to hours or minutes. The bootstrapping process encapsulates key MLOps decisions like the various components of the repository, the structure of the repository, the link between model development and model deployment and technology choices for each of the phases of the Data Science process.   

The best way to consume this accelerator will be to choose a complex use case that reflects most of your organisationâ€™s needs from a Data Science perspective and start adjusting this accelerator to accommodate those requirements. The first use case may take longer to deliver, however, once the process has been ironed out, subsequent use cases can be onboarded in a matter of days if not hours.  

The architecture for this accelerator, which has been described in more detail here <insert hyperlink> provides a framework for end-to-end MLOps, from provisioning of resources to the deployment and retraining of models in a production environment. The architecture highlights the key personas that are responsible for each of the stages and lists the key activities that are performed in each phase of a Data Science project. The architecture is based on the concepts of inner, middle and outer loops for a Data Science process which are explained in detail here <insert hyperlink> 


## Getting started with AML Classical ML Demo
  
The demo follows the Classical Machine Learning Pattern with Azure Machine Learning.

Please follow the instructions to execute the demo accordingly:
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
&nbsp;&nbsp;...

Following the demo helps to understand the concept of the solution accelerator, architectual pattern, and ongoing work extending the solution accelerator to other patterns. Feel free to replace the inner loop model with your model and rerun accordingly.

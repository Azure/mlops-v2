# Azure MLOps (v2) solution accelerator

MLOps or Machine Learning Ops is a set of practices that aims to automate and operationalise the deployment and maintenance of machine learning models across various stages of the lifecycle of a Data Science process. The purpose of an MLOps process is to drive efficiency, increase repeatability and predictability, enable reuse of code and drive consistency across projects. This enables Data Science teams to deploy Machine Learning models to production reliably and efficiently.  

While MLOps has many overlapping concepts with DevOps and can be seen as a derivation of DevOps, it varies significantly from DevOps due to the nature of Data Science projects. The following Microsoft articles provide a perspective on MLOps from various viewpoints: 

[MLOps using Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/mlops/#features) 

[Cloud Adoption Framework Guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/ai-machine-learning-mlops) 

[How: Machine Learning Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-model-management-and-deployment) 


## Prerequisites: Repository Overview

The solution accelerator provides a modular end-to-end approach for MLOps in Azure based on pattern architectures. As each organization is unique, we do not expect that each pattern architecture will suit all organizations, however, Digital Natives or enterprises will be able to deploy an MLOps ecosystem fast, simple, reliable, modular, and secure. The time to product is measurable shorter under incerased scalability.

Following are the key principles that have been applied while building the accelerator: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ**Simplicity** 
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ**Segregation of duties & Security**
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ**Reusability**
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ**Modularity**
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚úÖ**Enterprise readiness**

This repo provides a templatised approach for the end-to-end Data Science process and focuses on driving efficiency at each stage. For example, it can take a significant amount of time to bootstrap a new Data Science project, hence the repo provides templates that can be reused to establish a cookie cutter approach for the bootstrapping process to shorten the process from days to hours or minutes.

The best way to consume this accelerator will be to choose a complex use case that reflects most of your organisation‚Äôs needs from a Data Science perspective and start adjusting this accelerator to accommodate those requirements. The first use case may take longer to deliver, however, once the process has been ironed out, subsequent use cases can be onboarded in a matter of days if not hours.

Following the demo helps to understand the concept of the solution accelerator, architectual pattern, and ongoing work extending the solution accelerator to other patterns. Feel free to replace the inner loop model with your model and rerun accordingly.

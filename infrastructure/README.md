# Azure MLOps (v2) solution accelerator: Infrastructure

This repository includes all infrastructure deployed as the outer loop from the [MLOps v2](https://github.com/Azure/mlops-v2) solution accelerator.

The repo itself functions as a standalone entity that agnosticly holds all infrastructure requirements for each individual architectual pattern.


## ℹ️ Infrastructure Deployment

Azure services deployed:

[Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/)

[Azure Machine Learning Compute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-compute-target)

[Azure Machine Learning Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-workspace)

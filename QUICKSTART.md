# Quickstart


## Setting Variables
---

For a quickstart, the only variables needed to be set are in 'config-infra-dev.yml':
* If your location (Azure Regtion) is different from 'northeurope' then you'll have to adjust it to the desired one p.ex. 'westus' like here: 'location: westus'
* the function of 'namespace' is to make all your artifacts, that you're going to deploy, unique. Since there's going to be a Storage Account deployed, it has to adhere to the naming limitations of these (3-24 characters, all lowercase letters or numbers)
* as of (20220405) the 'ado_service_connection_rg' needs to have contributor permission subscription wide, since there's two resource groups being created: one for the Terraform state, and the second, which contains the artifacts for the Machine Learning Workspace (Storage Account, Key Vault, Application Insights, Container Registry). You then have to create a service connection in your ADO project, which has the same name ' or adjust it here accordingly.


## Deploying Infrastructure via ADO (Azure DevOps)
---

To daploy the infrastructure in ADO (Azure DevOps), you will have to have an organization and a project, with the mentioned service connection configured.
Then under pipelines you'll create a new pipeline and choose 'infrastructure\terraform\pipelines\tf-ado-deploy-infra.yml' as the source. 
   
   You can then run the pipeline, which should create the following artifacts:
   * Resource Group for Terraform State including Storage Account
   * Resource Group for your Workspace including Storage Account, Container Registry, Application Insights, Keyvault and the Azure Machine Learning Workspace itself.

   > If you didn't change the variable 'enable_aml_computecluster' from 'true' to 'false' a compute cluster is created as defined in 'infrastructure\terraform\modules\aml-workspace\main.tf'


As of now (20220410) the Terraform infrastructure pipeline will create a new pair of Terraform state Resource Group and Machine Learning workspace Resource Group every time it runs, with a slightly different name (number 10x).

The successfully run pipeline should look like this:

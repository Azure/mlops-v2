# Deployment Guide - Azure DevOps Repositories and Pipelines

This document will guide you through deploying the MLOps V2 project generator and projects using only Azure DevOps to host source repositories and pipelines.

**Requirements:**
- If using Terraform to create and manage infrastructure from Azure DevOps, install the [Terraform extension for Azure DevOps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.custom-terraform-tasks).
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) with `azure-devops` extension.
- Azure subscription(s) based on if you are deploying Prod only or Prod and Dev environments
- Ability to create Azure service principals to access / create Azure resources from Azure DevOps
- Git bash, WSL, or another shell script editor on your local machine


## Setup MLOps V2 and a New MLOps Project in Azure DevOps

1. <details>
   <summary>Create Service Principals</summary>
   For the use of the demo, the creation of one or two service principles is required, depending on how many environments, you want to work on (Dev or Prod or Both). These principles can be created using one of the methods below:
      <details>
      <summary>Create from Azure Cloud Shell</summary>
      1.1 Launch the <a href="https://shell.azure.com"> Azure Cloud Shell </a>. (If this the first time you have launched the cloud shell, you will be required to create a storage account for the cloud shell.)
      
      1.2 If prompted, choose **Bash** as the environment used in the Cloud Shell. You can also change environments in the drop-down on the top navigation bar

      ![PS_CLI_1](./images/PS_CLI1_1.png)

      1.3 Copy the bash commands below to your computer and update the **projectName**, **subscriptionId**, and **environment** variables with the values for your project. If you are creating both a Dev and Prod environment you will need to run this script once for each environment, creating a service principal for each. This command will also grant the **Contributor** role to the service principal in the subscription provided. This is required for Azure DevOps to properly deploy resources to that subscription. 

      ``` bash
      projectName="<your project name>"
      roleName="Contributor"
      subscriptionId="<subscription Id>"
      environment="<Dev|Prod>" #First letter should be capitalized
      servicePrincipalName="Azure-ARM-${environment}-${projectName}"
      # Verify the ID of the active subscription
      echo "Using subscription ID $subscriptionId"
      echo "Creating SP for RBAC with name $servicePrincipalName, with role $roleName and in scopes /subscriptions/$subscriptionId"
      az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $servicePrincipalName --role $roleName --scopes /subscriptions/$subscriptionId
      echo "Please ensure that the information created here is properly save for future use."
      ```
      
      1.4 Copy your edited commmands into the Azure Shell and run them (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd>).

      ![PS_CLI_1_4](./images/PS_CLI1_4.png) 

      
      1.4 After running these commands you will be presented with information related to the service principal. Save this information to a safe location, it will be used later in the demo to configure Azure DevOps.

      ```
      {
         "appId": "<application id>",
         "displayName": "Azure-ARM-dev-Sample_Project_Name",
         "password": "<password>",
         "tenant": "<tenant id>"
      }
      ```

      1.5 Repeat step 1.3 if you are creating service principals for Dev and Prod environments.

      1.6 Close the Cloud Shell once the service principals are created. 
      
      </details>
      <details>
      <summary>Create from Azure Portal</summary>
      1.1. Navigate to <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade/quickStartType~/null/sourceType/Microsoft_AAD_IAM">Azure App Registrations</a> 

      1.2. Select "new registration".

      ![PS2](./images/SP-setup2.png)

      1.3. Go through the process of creating a Service Principle (SP) selecting "Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)" and name it  "Azure-ARM-Dev-ProjectName". Once created, repeat and create a new SP named "Azure-ARM-Prod-ProjectName". Please replace "ProjectName" with the name of your project so that the service principal can be uniquely identified. 

      1.4. Go to "Certificates & Secrets" and add for each SP "New client secret", then store the value and secret seperately.

      1.5. To assign the necessary permissions to these principals, select your respective <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade?">subscription</a>  and go to IAM. Select +Add then select "Add Role Assigment.

      ![PS3](./images/SP-setup3.png)

      1.6. Select Contributor and add members selecting + Select Members. Add the member "Azure-ARM-Dev-ProjectName" as create before.

      ![SP4](./images/SP-setup4.png)

      1.7. Repeat step here, if you deploy Dev and Prod into the same subscription, otherwise change to the prod subscription and repeat with "Azure-ARM-Prod-ProjectName". The basic SP setup is successfully finished.

## Outer Loop: Deploying Infrastructure via Azure DevOps
---
This step deploys the training pipeline to the Azure Machine Learning workspace created in the previous steps. 

<details>
<summary> Run Azure Infrastructure pipeline </summary>
 1. Go to your Github cloned repo and select the "config-infra-prod.yml" file.
   
   ![ADO Run4](./images/ADO-run4.png)
   
   Under global, there's two values namespace and postfix. These values should render the names of the artifacts to create unique. Especially the name for the storage account, which has the most rigid constraints, like uniqueness Azure wide and 3-5 lowercase characters and numbers. So please change namespace and/or postfix to a value of your liking and remember to stay within the contraints of a storage account name as mentioned above. Then save, commit, push, pr to get these values into the pipeline.
   
   If your are running a Deep Learning workload such as CV or NLP, you have to ensure your GPU compute is availible in your deployment zone. Please replace as shown above your location to eastus. Example:
   
    namespace: [5 max random new letters]
    postfix: [4 max random new digits]
    location: eastus
    
   Please repeat this step for "config-infra-dev.yml" and "config-infra-prod.yml"!

   2. Go to ADO pipelines
   
   ![ADO Pipelines](./images/ADO-pipelines.png)
   
   3. Select "New Pipeline".
   
   ![ADO Run1](./images/ADO-run1.png)

   </details>
   
   
## Inner Loop: Checkpoint
   
   At this point, the infrastructure is configured and the Inner Loop of the MLOps Architecture is deployed. We are ready to move to our trained model to production.      

   
## Inner / Outer Loop: Moving to Production - Introduction
---
         
   >**NOTE: This is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline which runs a linear regression to predict taxi fares in NYC. The pipeline is made up of components, each serving  different functions, which can be registered with the workspace, versioned, and reused with various inputs and outputs.**

   >**Prepare Data
   This component takes multiple taxi datasets (yellow and green) and merges/filters the data, and prepare the train/val and evaluation datasets.
   Input: Local data under ./data/ (multiple .csv files)
   Output: Single prepared dataset (.csv) and train/val/test datasets.**

   >**Train Model
   This component trains a Linear Regressor with the training set.
   Input: Training dataset
   Output: Trained model (pickle format)**
   
   >**Evaluate Model
   This component uses the trained model to predict taxi fares on the test set.
   Input: ML model and Test dataset
   Output: Performance of model and a deploy flag whether to deploy or not.
   This component compares the performance of the model with all previous deployed models on the new test dataset and decides whether to promote or not model into production. Promoting model into production happens by registering the model in AML workspace.**

   >**Register Model
   This component scores the model based on how accurate the predictions are in the test set.
   Input: Trained model and the deploy flag.
   Output: Registered model in Azure Machine Learning.**

   ![ADO Run3](./images/ADO-run3.png)
   
   6. Select "main" as a branch and choose:
      For Classical Machine Learning:
         Managed Batch Endpoint '/mlops/devops-pipelines/deploy-batch-endpoint-pipeline.yml'
         Managed Online Endpoint '/mlops/devops-pipelines/deploy-online-endpoint-pipeline.yml'
      For Computer Vision: 
         Managed Online Endpoint '/mlops/devops-pipelines/deploy-batch-endpoint-pipeline.yml'
      
      Then select "Continue".  
   
   ![ADO Run10](./images/ADO-run10.png)

   7. The resource repository will need to be modified to request the correct repository from your project. Modify the Repository section as shown below

   ![resourceRepoADO](./images/ado-pipeline-resourcesRepoADO.png)
   
   8. Batch/Online endpoint names need to be unique, so please change [your endpointname] to another unique name and then select "Run".

   ![ADO Run11](./images/ADO-batch-pipeline.png)
   
   **IMPORTANT: If the run fails due to an existing online endpoint name, recreate the pipeline as discribed above and change [your endpointname] to [your endpointname [random number]]"**
   
   9.  When the run completes, you will see:
   
   ![ADO Run12](./images/ADO-batch-pipeline-run.png)
   
  Now the Inner Loop is connected to the Outer of the MLOps Architecture and inference has been run.
  </details>
  


## Next Steps
---

This finishes the demo according to the architectual pattern: Azure Machine Learning Classical Machine Learning. Next you can dive into your Azure Machine Learning service in the Azure Portal and see the inference results of this example model. 

As elements of Azure Machine Learning are still in development, the following components are not part of this demo:
- Secure Workspaces
- Model Monitoring for Data/Model Drift
- Automated Retraining
- Model and Infrastructure triggers

Interim it is recommended to schedule the deployment pipeline for development for complete model retraining on a timed trigger.
